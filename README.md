# Source-code-multieditor
edit, visualize, analyze source code + templates for particular parts mainly used for C and C++

Project features:

*  analyze large source code project
*  templates might help to quickly find required source code in structure I need for particular programming language (time, file open/read/write, ...)
*  editing source code (refractoring ...)
*  finding bugs (logically inserting assertions ...)
*  similar features to cppcheck, clang-tidy...
*  and more
         
          
         
In the future i am open to make Qt application in order to better visualize source code, which will be helpful in many ways to understand what is going on in every piece of code provided. IDE might be in the future, mainly for C, C++, but who knows


11. July 2020:     almost done with parsing in file "char_read.cpp", going to make OOP structure, intergrate it into project and start coding analyzing code.
