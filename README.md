# Source-code-multieditor
edit, visualize, analyze source code + templates for particular parts mainly used for C and C++

The main reasons I have decided to do this kind of project are:

*  analyze large source code project and understand its structure
*  templates might help to quickly find required source code in structure I need for particular programming language (time, file open/read/write, ...)
*  editing source code (refractoring ...)
*  finding bugs (logically inserting assertions ...)
         
          
         
In the future i am open to make Qt application in order to better visualize source code, which will be helpful in many ways to understand what is going on in every piece of code provided.
In the far future i am heading to make something like autonomous programing framework ( but, i have no idea if i could reach that point. ).
